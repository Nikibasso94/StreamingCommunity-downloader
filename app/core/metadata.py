"""Plot, genres, rating, artwork and a trailer for one title.

All of it comes from the title page's own props — the Inertia payload the panel
already fetches to find ``tmdb_id``. So metadata costs no request of its own,
needs no account anywhere, and works on a fresh install with nothing configured.

TMDB was tried as a second provider and removed. Measured against the props on
real titles it was not an upgrade: the site copies its synopses from TMDB, so
the text was usually identical, while the round trip lost a trailer on one
title, a logo on another, and 1100 characters of plot on a third. Paying an API
key to fetch a worse copy of data already in hand is a bad trade, and the
"three providers" this module started with are now honestly one.

``tmdb_id`` is still read and still exposed: it is free here, and it is the
identifier a fallback stream provider would resolve against (see
``app.core._shared.resolve_stream``).

Enrichment happens when a detail modal opens, one title at a time — never per
search card. Twenty-one titles per search is twenty-one requests for data
nineteen of which nobody will read.
