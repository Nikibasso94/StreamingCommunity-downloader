"""SQLite store for panel users, sessions, requests and notifications.

Deliberately stdlib-only: the panel is self-hosted by non-experts, so adding an
ORM or a separate database service would be a maintenance cost with no payoff at
this scale. What SQLite does buy us over the existing JSON files is transactions,
UNIQUE constraints (request deduplication) and atomic compare-and-set (state
transitions, work claiming).

Schema versioning uses ``PRAGMA user_version`` and the ordered ``MIGRATIONS``
list below — every migration runs exactly once, in order, inside a transaction.
An entry is normally a list of SQL statements; it may also be a callable, for
the rare migration whose decision cannot be expressed in SQL because it depends
on whether the database already existed.
